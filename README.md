This project explores the Black-Scholes option pricing model, focusing on its derivation using
partial differential equations and its connection to the 1D heat equation. We analyze its strengths
and limitations, boundary conditions, and evaluate its effectiveness by comparing predicted option
prices to real market data. This study highlights the model’s importance in the real world use of
PDEs and PDEs’ role in financial mathematics.
